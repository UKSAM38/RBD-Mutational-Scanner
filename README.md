# RBD-Mutational-Scanner
A bioinformatics tool for Deep Mutational Scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD. This Python-based scanner simulates single nucleotide variants to identify theoretical protein mutations, filtering out synonymous and stop-codon changes. Developed as part of PhD research at the University of Leicester.
